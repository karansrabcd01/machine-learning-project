# Customer Review Summarization

## 🔍 Overview
**Customer Review Summarization** is an AI-powered tool that automatically summarizes product reviews to extract meaningful insights from large volumes of user-generated content. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and transformer-based models to generate concise summaries of reviews, aiding consumers in decision-making and helping businesses understand customer sentiment.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Amazon Product Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arhamrumi/amazon-product-reviews)
- The dataset includes thousands of product reviews from various categories.

## ⚙️ Features
- Automatically fetches and processes review data.
- Cleans and preprocesses text (stopword removal, tokenization, etc.).
- Utilizes state-of-the-art summarization models.
- Evaluation using ROUGE metric.
- Generates extractive and abstractive summaries.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab
- NLP Libraries: `nltk`, `spacy`, `transformers`
- Evaluation: `rouge_score`
- Dataset Management: `kaggle`

## 🧠 Model Description
- Preprocessing includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- Utilized pre-trained transformer models (like BERT or T5) for summarization.
- Evaluated using ROUGE score for summary precision and recall.

## 📊 Results
- Summarization results show strong alignment with user sentiments.
- Effectively condenses multi-paragraph reviews into 1-2 meaningful sentences.
